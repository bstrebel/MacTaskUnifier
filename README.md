# MacTaskUnifier

A simple wrapper to launch TaskUnifier from http://taskunifier.sourceforge.net. It's just a workaround to avoid DH keypair (due to outdated Java 1.6) and GUI loading error (when starting the Java 8 bundle).

See MacLauncher script in the Application directory for details.

Download and unpack MacTaskUnifier.zip to your Application directory. The TaskUnifier binaries are loaded if you run the app.

Enjoy TaskUnifier on MacOS!
